## General Info
This project is a, hopefully, unique take on a todo app. However, this ap builds upon a todo app by allowing for more complexity by implementing another dimension to its functionality. There is a possibility for an item to be done after or before another in a sort of roadmap structure.

## Technologies Used
This app will be written in a usual vanilla html, scss, ts stack. Nothing else is specially needed to complete the project.

## Features
* Add todo items. 
* Edit todo items through a form submitted to a database-driven backend.
* Change order of todo item completion through drap-drop interface.
* Data manipulated through either linked list data or graph structure.

## Setup
Just clone the project and the project is ready for use.

## Usage
Start up an instance of the app:
```
    npm start
```

## Project Status
Until all the features are added to the project, it will be in an ongoing status.

## Room for Improvement
This project will have basic functionality to things working at first. Then, more functionality will be added to all the features added. So, until all the features are added the project will be in an ongoing status.
